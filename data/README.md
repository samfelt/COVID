# Where this came from

This data is being pulled fromn https://www.covidtracking.com/

`covidtracking.com/api/v1/states/daily.json` returns a json blob with the daily
results for every day of every state. With the new changes it looks you can't
pull daily data for a single state, so I am just pulling all of the states.
